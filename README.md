# test-assignment

## Description
```
1. Created Title Component to keep design consitent.
2. Created Price filter component.
3. Worked on shifts data as given in document and created Shift Card Component for Read Operation.
4. Created Side drawer (which will open on clicking add shift button or edit icon).
5. Covered Add Shift functionality which will create a new shift and add to read page.
6. Added ability to load and edit shift related data.
    i. Created Multiple Date Picker component from scratch to add multiple dates.
    ii. As dates are added there appears options to add start time, end time, price and type.
7. Added field validations on title, dates, start time, end time and type based on document.
8. Ability to delete a shift and update UI.

I have followed Vue, Nuxt and Vuetify.js for this project and tried to follow all best practices.

I have tried to keep UI consitent and as given in design with validations, while giving the CRUD functionality for the Application.

I strategied to implement VUEX store after the functionality is done but unfortunately while doing that got short of time constraint, still some of those functions are there in store folder.
